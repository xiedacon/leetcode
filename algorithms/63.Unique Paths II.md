#Unique Paths II

Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

For example,

There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

```
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
```

The total number of unique paths is 2.

**Note**: m and n will be at most 100.

**Solution:**

```java
  public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
    int width = obstacleGrid[0].length;
    int[] a = new int[width];
    a[0] = 1;
    for (int[] row : obstacleGrid) {
      for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
        if (row[j] == 1)
          a[j] = 0;
        else if (j > 0)
          a[j] += a[j - 1];
      }
    }
    return a[width - 1];
  }
```
